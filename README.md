# Malware Analysis Tool

This repository contains a tool for analyzing and reverse-engineering malware samples. It extracts relevant information, identifies Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and visualizes the control flow graph of the malware.

## Features

- Analyze malware samples to extract API calls, registry keys, and file operations.
- Reverse-engineer malware to disassemble code, construct control flow graphs, and identify potential entry points.
- Identify IOCs such as IP addresses, domain names, and code patterns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pefile` library
- `networkx` library
- `matplotlib` library

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
