# Malware Analysis Tool

This Python script provides a set of tools for analyzing potentially malicious executable files. It's designed to help security researchers and malware analysts extract valuable information from suspicious files.

## Features

- Analyze PE (Portable Executable) files
- Extract API calls, registry keys, and file operations
- Reverse engineer the malware to identify function calls and data flows
- Construct and visualize control flow graphs
- Identify potential entry points
- Extract indicators of compromise (IoCs) such as IP addresses and domain names
- Identify common malicious code patterns

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pefile
- networkx
- matplotlib
- subprocess

For a complete list of dependencies, see `requirements.txt`.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the script with a suspicious file as an argument:
   ```
   python malware_analysis.py path/to/suspicious/file.exe
   ```

3. The script will perform various analyses and print the results to the console. It will also generate a visualization of the control flow graph.

## Caution

This tool is intended for educational and research purposes only. Always handle potentially malicious files with extreme caution in a secure, isolated environment.
